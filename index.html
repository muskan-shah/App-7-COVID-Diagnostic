Brief Description of Goal of Code:
The goal of this code is create my own survey with a health issue similar to the one from the last app. Another goal is to add an image within the app at some point.
 
Known Issues:
The coding of this app was very similar to that of app 3. I knew the "results" page was what I struggled with most in app 3, so I made sure to really go through the code for that section carefully, line-by-line, to look for potential errors. Other then that, this app went fairly smoothly, including adding the image.
Going back and looking through the rubric from app 3, I noticed my header for the results page disappears when the percentages appear. I tried testing several different solutions (creating a new page, getting rid of the show results button and having the app go directly to the results instead, etc.), but I was unable to figure out a solution that worked. I had this same issue last app as well, and am hoping a mentor may be able to give me some more insight into how to solve this issue.
